# Pong-Game
The game I created for my highschool programming class's summative. 
It is a remake of the iconic pong game, simple and fun to play with 2 players.
All coded in Java.

Originally the game also included a music.wav file but since gitHub wouldn't let me upload anything bigger than 25mb I removed
it for this version.
